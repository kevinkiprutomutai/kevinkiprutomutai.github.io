Welcome! I am a Graduate Student in the Chen-Konno Electromagnetics and Antenna Engineering Laboratory at Tohoku University in Sendai, Miyagi, Japan. While my primary research interests include [leaky-wave antennas and millimeter wave imaging](publications.md), I am also interested in the intersection between computational electromagnetics and machine learning. Apart from my academic experience, I spent some time at Huawei as a Packet Core Network Engineer where I had the opportunity to [work](cv.md) with Telco. operators in both Kenya and Somalia in a number of projects.
