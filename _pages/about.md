Welcome! I am a Graduate Student in the [Chen-Konno Electromagnetics and Antenna Engineering Laboratory](http://www.chenq.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/) at Tohoku University in Sendai, Miyagi, Japan. Apart from my academic experience, I spent some time at Huawei as a Packet Core Network Engineer where I had the opportunity to work with major Telecommunication operators in both Kenya and Somalia in a number of projects.

Research
======
My current research is in millimeter wave imaging where I am exploring leaky-wave antennas as sensors. My long term interest lies in high resolution, three-dimensional imaging exploiting holographic reconstruction techniques and low-cost, low-profile electronically reconfigurable structures at the physical layer.
