Welcome! I am currently a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in the [Mittleman group](https://sites.brown.edu/mittleman/people/) at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. At the moment I am primarily engaged in applied electromagnetics research but in my free time I've been working on a number of personal, cross-domain side projects that I will post on this website. If you'd like know more about my background and qualifications, check out [this](https://kevinkiprutomutai.github.io/moreabout/) page.

Research
======
My [research](https://kevinkiprutomutai.github.io/publications/) is on millimeter wave and terahertz imaging/sensing where I am exploring leaky-wave antennas as sensors. My long term interest lies in high resolution, three-dimensional imaging exploiting holographic reconstruction techniques and low-cost, low-profile electronically reconfigurable structures at the physical layer. An ancillary focus of my work is to investigate
the applicability of said structures in communications scenarios.

If any of the stuff I mentioned above piques your interest, feel free to reach out for collaborations through any of the social media links on the side if you are on PC or via the "Follow" button at the top if you are on mobile.
